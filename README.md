# ML_SVM
This program performsclassification of Caltech-101 dataset. 
It uses SIFT features (using OpenCV) to extract useful information (features) from every image. 
Then it clusters these features into some groups with a similar meaning (using K-Means). 
By doing so it creates a dictionary of visual features. 
Then the program uses an SVM to perform the classification.
